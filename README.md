# Crypto
Project: Crypto predict
For this project I will try to train a machine such that for analyzing a set of data (in this case crypto currency), will be able to predict an outcome. 
The data will be ploted in alongside the actual data in real life. 
The main principle of this project is to give the machine a set of data from a period of time and to determine the outcome for the upcoming days. 
More data will mean more accurate results , but with a longer execution time of the program.
